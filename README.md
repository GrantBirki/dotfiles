# dotfiles 📂

Dotfiles and general machine / terminal configurations

## Setup ⚙️

If you wish to install these files on a brand new machine, simply do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `script/install`

> This will symlink all the defined files in the `script/install` script and backup your current dotfiles so they can be recovered later if something is not working correctly

If anything goes wrong, you can always run `script/restore` to roll back your original dotfiles
